//pehle xhr request chalti thi for api calls and fetching data from a database
//but ye thoda implementation or error hndling me utna smooth ni tha
// callback hell was major problem then using xhr

//intro to fetch() web api
//The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest.
//the Fetch API uses Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.

//The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status
//agar fetch ne error diya hai koi bhi 404 ya 500 to vo as a response ayega not as a error...error bs tabhi aata hai jb api request succesful ni ho payi hai
